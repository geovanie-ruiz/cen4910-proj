# cen4910-proj
Combined repository for all three groups.

This project consumes the SW API project. Documentation for this project can be found here: https://swapi.dev/documentation

## Original Project Definition
Project - Star Wars Game

Data scrape from that API to get character images - Django REST framework (swapi.dev)

Using SpringBoot framework for backend
Using MySQL database integration with SpringBoot
Using GItHub for repository to share code for groups
Using React or Thyme Leaf for front end website UI
Using React Native or Flutter for Mobile App Front end UI

Create a game where the users sign in (security) and play a game where the characters scrapped form the API has to go through some challenges to save the day.  The user information is stored in the database along with scores and other gameplay information.  Implemented with a website, and mobile app for the front-end UI.
3 groups - backend (SpringBoot), UI website (React or Thyme Leaf), UI mobile app (React Native or Flutter).

I have placed you in three groups.  Please discuss with each other and decide which group will be assigned the backend, or UI Website, or UI mobile app.
